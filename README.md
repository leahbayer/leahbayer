## About me 👋
- I am currently a postdoctoral fellow under Dr. Chris Rota and Dr. Brent Murry at West Virginia University where I am analyzing carp data along an invasion gradient in the Ohio River ⛰🐟
- My research interests include quantitative ecology, population dynamics, and native species conservation 🖥

- I completed my doctoral degree in Biology at the University of Arkansas with Dr. Dan Magoulick in July 2024 🐗
  - My dissertation focused on how drought, invasive species, and stream permanence affect populations of native crayfish species in Arkansas and Missouri 🦞
    
- I completed my Bachelors degree in Biology and Mathematics at Youngstown State University (go ‘guins) in 2018 🐧
  - I worked with Dr. Alicia Prieto Langarica and Dr. Pamela Harris on geometric properties of Kostant's weight multiplicity formula 📈
  - I worked with Dr. Richard Ciotola and Dr. Colleen McLean on fern community structure 🪴
  - I worked with Dr. Alicia Prieto Langarica on modeling songbird migration patterns 🐦
  - I participated in National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (NSF REU) programs at the University of Arkansas studying crayfish population dynamics and the University of South Dakota studying songbird nesting sucess 🦞🐦


- In addition to my love for traveling, I stay active by hiking, snowboarding, and kayaking. I also enjoy reading, cooking, and playing board games and cards ✈🥾🏂🛶📚🍳🎲♠
